# Streamlit Company Reviews Analysis

Glassdoor is an online platform where old or new employees can comment on companies and is also used for job search. Our project talks about analyzing the reviews and feedbacks from the customer.

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze employee reviews posted on Glassdoor. Glassdoor is a company review site and an information resource for job search. In this project, I collected data from glassdoor company reviews to gain insights about employee emotions and company characteristics.

We can evaluate these analysis results from two different perspectives:
* First of all, if we look at the job seekers, these online resources can provide insight into the fit and management style of a particular business. for example, negative feedback can inform about common themes in a business, such as below-average pay or poor work-life balance.
* From the company's point of view, companies can listen and analyze reviews to understand what their employees are saying about them and how to improve their workplaces.

Through this analysis, we hope to provide actionable recommendations for a company to improve its workplace culture and increase its reputation among current and potential employees.
What do employees like and dislike in their company? The company aims to provide answers on what to do to retain its employees and increase loyalty.
The data was scraping with web scraping and analyzed using NLP technology.
